# print-tech-quiz-app

I started my career in the printing industry, and Iâ€™ll always retain my fondness for well-crafted, unique and meaningful printed material. This small interactive page gives the user a brief, hopefully fun, introduction to some aspects of the printing process they may not have known about before. The quiz is built with jQuery and LESS, and performs its animations with ordinary CSS `@keyframes` rules.
